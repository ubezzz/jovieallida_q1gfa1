    <p> I am Jovie Oralie Allida. Known for being a social butterfly, talkative, and noisy. 14 years old and lives in Kidapawan City. I love socializing and going out with friends but at the same time, I also love staying inside the house. I'm an active member of a Christian Community, The CFC-Youth For Christ and has been serving the community for more than a year along with my family.
        At this moment, I feel so happy to be here. To be with my PISAY friends and to experience my highschool life in a different level. I do miss home, but I can truly say, Pisay has been my second home. </p>
